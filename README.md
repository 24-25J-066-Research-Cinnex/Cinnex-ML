# Cinnex  

Cinnex is a final-year research project focused on integrating advanced digital technologies to benefit cinnamon farming. The project comprises four main function-based components:  

1. *Cinnamon Price Forecast*: Predicts cinnamon prices based on historical market data, regional demand and supply trends, and economic indicators.  
2. *Leaf Disease Prediction*: Detects cinnamon leaf diseases based on observable symptoms.
3. *Leaf Disease Prediction*: Detects cinnamon leaf diseases based on observable symptoms.
4. *Cinnamon Grade Identification System.

## Functions  

### Cinnamon Price Forecast  
Predicts cinnamon prices by analyzing:  
- Historical market data.  
- Regional demand and supply variations.  
- Economic indicators.  

#### Model 1  
Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including LSTM and regression models, to provide location-specific and accurate price predictions.  
---
### Leaf Spot Disease Prediction  
Predicts the presence of leaf spot disease in cinnamon plants based on visible symptoms and diagnostic patterns.  

#### Model 1  
Employs image processing and classification algorithms to detect and diagnose diseases accurately.
