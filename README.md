Cinnex is a final-year research project focused on integrating advanced digital technologies to benefit cinnamon farming. The project comprises four main function-based components:  

1. **Cinnamon Price Forecast**: Predicts cinnamon prices based on historical market data, region and Cinnamon Grades.  
2. **Leaf Spot Disease Prediction**: Detects cinnamon leaf diseases based on observable symptoms using advanced image processing.  
3. **Cinnamon Species Identification**: Identifies cinnamon species using machine learning models and one-shot learning techniques.  
4. **Cinnamon Grade Identification System**: Ensures precise and consistent cinnamon grading through image recognition techniques.
